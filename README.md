Streamlit Web Application - Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analysis
This web application analyzes sleep health and lifestyle factors, leveraging machine learning models for both clustering and classification. It features pages for exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and predictions using supervised and unsupervised techniques.

Features:
Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, balances datasets, and prepares data for machine learning.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizes relationships and distributions of key features.
Machine Learning:
Clustering: Uses K-means to group individuals based on demographic and lifestyle factors.
Classification: Employs a Decision Tree and Random Forest for predicting sleep disorders.
Predictions: Allows users to input custom data and get model predictions.

File Structure:
app.py: Main Streamlit application code.
requirements.txt: Python dependencies for the app.
README.md: Project documentation.
